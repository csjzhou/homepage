>Trust is defines trust as “the attitude that an agent will help achieve an individual's goals in a situation characterized 
by uncertainty and vulnerability" (Lee and See 2004).

Trust has been realised as one of the most important factors in management and organisational behaviour for all personal 
and business decision making as well as for efficiency and task performance. It is also found to be a critical factor
driving human behaviour in human-machine interactions with automation systems in modern complex high-risk domains such 
as aviation, and the military command and control. This project aims to develop automatic, real-time, and implicit methods
of assessing human-machine interactions and analysing multimodal and social behavioural features to provide dynamic measure 
of trust and to perform uncertainty-aware trust calibration. The research outcomes will help achieve some adaptive system 
response according to users’ current trust perception as a strategy to improve the user’s trust and the effectiveness of 
communication between the user and the system. This will help improve their overall system interaction experience, task 
performance, and decision making.
